transition_detection_prompt: |
  <image>You are observing someone performing a procedural task. Based on the current frame, 
  predict what substep they are currently performing. Answer with just the substep name, 
  no explanation needed.

dialogue_generation_prompt: |

  They just completed: {prev_substep}
  They are now starting: {curr_substep}
  
  Generate a brief, encouraging dialogue to help them with this transition.
  Be specific and helpful. Keep it under 20 words.
