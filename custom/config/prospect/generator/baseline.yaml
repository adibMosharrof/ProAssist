# Prompts for VLM
transition_detection_prompt: |
  <image>You are observing someone performing a procedural task. Based on the current frame, 
  predict what substep they are currently performing. Answer with just the substep name, 
  no explanation needed.

dialogue_generation_prompt: |
  <image>You are a helpful assistant observing someone perform a procedural task.
  They just completed: {prev_substep}
  They are now starting: {curr_substep}
  
  Generate a brief, encouraging dialogue to help them with this transition.
  Be specific and helpful. Keep it under 20 words.

# Transition detection strategy
use_gt_substeps: true  # Use ground truth substeps for baseline (Day 1)
# For Day 2 DST-enhanced, we'll predict substeps from VLM

# KV cache accumulation
use_kv_cache: false  # Set to true to enable KV cache accumulation across frames
max_seq_len: 4096    # Maximum sequence length before overflow
reserved_seq_len: 128  # Reserved tokens for new input
