I plan to submit the proassist work extension that I have planned to a top venue like CVPR, ACL or similar venues.

Your job is to act as a reviewer for these venues and give me an honest feedback of my work.

You have to find flaws in my approach, identify weaknesses and novelty.

Try to find out things that are vague in my approach that reviewers might question.

There is a common feedback, limited technical innovation or improvements are incremental. 

See if this comment will be valid, if so try to address it in your response. 

Point out specific areas where the work could be seen as incremental and suggest how to emphasize or enhance the novelty.

You should have a section about clarifying questions that reviewers might raise.

You can give some suggestions for improvements.

Finally, provide a verdict where you give it a score out of 10 and the reasons behind it in bullet points.
