Folder A: data/proassist_dst_manual_data
Folder B: data/proassist/processed_data

folder A contains the tsv files. i have made a small change in here, i have created folders for each of the datasets. now the tsv files are in the subfolders. i have made the structure similar to folder B.

folder A contains the DST data, folderr B contains the original data. you will find the ground truth dialogs in there.
